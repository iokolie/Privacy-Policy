  <h1>Privacy Policy for 2EAZY Wellness</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 7/3/2024</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how 2EAZY Wellness (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects data related to the use of the camera on your device. Our app uses the camera strictly to scan QR codes for gym check-ins and related functionalities. By using our app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <h3>Camera Access</h3>
  <p>Our app requires access to your device’s camera solely for the purpose of scanning QR codes. This feature enables gym members to quickly check in, access gym services, or verify membership details.</p>

  <h3>Data Processing</h3>
  <p>When you scan a QR code, the camera is activated only during the scanning process. The QR code data is processed locally on your device and is used exclusively to provide the intended gym services.</p>

  <h3>No Storage of Images</h3>
  <p>We do not capture, record, store, or transmit any images, video, or any other data from your camera. Once the QR code is scanned and the required information is extracted, no camera data is saved on your device or on our servers.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Protection and Security</h2>
  <h3>Local Processing</h3>
  <p>All QR code scanning operations are performed directly on your device, ensuring that your data remains private and secure.</p>

  <h3>No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
  <p>We do not share any camera data with third parties. The information obtained from QR code scans is used solely for providing gym-related services.</p>

  <h3>Data Retention</h3>
  <p>Any information processed via the camera is used immediately for its intended purpose and is not retained beyond that use.</p>

  <h2>4. Compliance and Updates</h2>
  <p>We adhere to applicable data protection laws and regulations. This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. We encourage you to review this policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your data. Changes to this policy will be posted on our website and will take effect immediately upon posting.</p>
